# Helical Drone Animation Simulation
This project simulates a drone-like object following a helical flight path in a 3D space. Using Python and libraries like Matplotlib and NumPy, the animation visualizes the drone's motion in real-time, showcasing both its circular trajectory and vertical ascent.

This project involves creating a 3D simulation of a drone-like object following a helical flight path. The animation visualizes the drone's movement in real-time, demonstrating its ascent and circular trajectory in three-dimensional space. The simulation is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as Matplotlib for plotting and animation, and NumPy for numerical calculations.

**Key Features**
Drone Model: The Drone class simulates a drone with properties such as mass, drag coefficient, thrust, and position. The class includes methods to update the drone's position based on time.


Helical Flight Path: The drone follows a defined helical path characterized by a specific radius and vertical speed, giving it a realistic flight pattern.

3D Visualization: The simulation utilizes a 3D plot to represent the drone's position in space, with labeled axes for clarity.

Animation: The animation is rendered in real-time, showcasing the drone's continuous movement and trajectory.
